The docker application can be installed in Ubuntu under the terminal with the ``apt-get`` package manager toolkit with the following command: ::

        apt-get install docker.io 

Assuming that docker is installed, pull the ``repro-totem-ti`` image from Docker Hub by typing the command in the Linux terminal: ::

        docker pull compbiomed/repro-totem-ti
